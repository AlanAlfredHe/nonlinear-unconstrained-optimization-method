# Nonlinear Unconstrained Optimization Methods
This repository contrains three different methods implemented with MatLab for nonlinear unconstrained optimization, including Gradient Descent with Backtracking, Globalized Newton, and L-BFGS methods.


## Example
test.m (script) usse the discretized minimum surface problem as an example to show how to use different optimization methods.
